            <!-- Nmap Overview-->

            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><a href="Nmap.html"><b>Nmap</b></a></h3>
            <p>Nmap is primarily a port scanning tool, though it does have some host discovery capabilities. This consists of the tool 
                looking at a target and checking for any open ports by talking to it and depending on the response it gets from the target, 
                Nmap will be able to determine whether or not the port is open or closed (and in some cases, filtered). Nmap is considered one of the top port scanning tools 
                and so is considered a must know in the pen testing industry.
            </p>



            <!-- Nikto Overview-->
            <hr>
            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><a href="Nikto.html"><b>Nikto</b></a></h3>
            <p>
              Nikto is a web scanner. Nikto is quite similar to Nmap, as Nmap is also a scanning tool. The best way to think of it is – 
              Nmap was made to scan ports, and websites just happen to be a port scanned. Nikto however was made to scan websites. 
              It’s a very useful tool, during the scanning process Nikto gets information from the website such as what vulnerabilities 
              the website has, does it have any odd configurations, are there any exposed folders etc.
            </p>

            <!-- Burp Suite Overview-->
            <hr>
            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><a href="BurpSuite.html"><b>Burp Suite</b></a></h3>
            <p>
              Burp Suite is a proxy interception tool. It basically stands between your browser and the internet. If an HTTP request is on 
              its way, it intercepts it and gives it to you, allowing you the opportunity to alter the contents. It also have other 
              features like being used as a vulnerability scanner (if you have the pro version) or use it to brute force a page. Burp 
              Suite is possibly one of the most famous pen testing tools and is considered the best at what it does. Alternatives do 
              exist however they lack documentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              This page goes over tools that are useful, however not as useful as the other three. Zenmap is the GUI version 
              of nmap, providing many similar services as the original as well as additional features like being able to 
              visual the target topology as well as instantly change command arguments by switching profiles. There 
              is also Wget and cURL as well, both of which can be used to transfer data to and from servers, becoming 
              a useful tool when it comes to downloading (sensitive) files.

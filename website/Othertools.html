            <p><b>Pre knowledge:</b> 
                as a rule of thumb, its best to know common ports used beforehand. 
                For example knowing SSH = port 22, DNS = 53, HTTP/s = 80/443. 
                <br>This is because some services are bound to certain ports, and as such 
                if you recognise an open port you may recognise what service its related to.

            <p><b>Note:</b> 
                As I have already covered the arguments in the Nmap page, I will not cover it again here as 
                they are the same. <br> Also, I have noticed some tabs in the Zenmap tool may randomly stop and start working.

            <p>
                Zenmap is considered the ‘GUI’ version of Nmap. It does everything Nmap can do but it 
                presents it in a nicer format. <br>
                Zenmap and Nmap are made by the same organisation, so it has the same backing.<br>
                <img src="images/zenmap.png" alt = "running zenmap as root with an example scan">
            </p>


            <p>Zenmap is seen as an alternative to Nmap. Compared to Nmap, it is much more beginner friendly – 
                it’s a lot less daunting than the console variant. Zenmap uses the same commands as Nmap, 
                the only difference is the formatting.<br><br> Zenmap organises the command in a more user friendly 
                way by breaking the arguments down into sections around the application.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                For example, Zenmap has its own dedicated field were you can place the target IP address, 
                making the input process more smooth line. It also chops up the Zenmap result and separates 
                it across multiple tabs you can look through, making it easier to digest the info.<br>
                <img src="images/zenmapsplittabs.png" alt = "Zenmap fields highlighted">
            </p>

            <p>
                Zenmap also allows you to make and save your own profiles, which is a nice feature for advanced users when doing detailed scans.<br>
                <img src="images/zenmapsaveprofile.png" alt = "Zenmap save profile feature">

            <p>
                Simply put, the tool can be run by just enter 'sudo zenmap'. It can also be run as 'zenmap' however doing 
                so will launch a version without root privilege. <br> I have also provided shortcuts on the LHS, however I've found
                they can sometimes act up.

            <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>
            <p>
                The main difference between the two outside of Zenmap being GUI based has to be the profile feature Zenmap has. 
                Zenmap has a dropdown field called ‘Profile’. <br><br>The profile field contains a set of premade scans – profiles 
                are group of commands that are categorised into options that are ready to go once selected and basicallyonly 
                require the user to enter the target IP.<br>
                <img src="images/zenmapprofilelist.png" alt = "list of profiles on zenmap">
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows users to quickly change the commands they are using in the matter of seconds.<br>
                <img src="images/zenmapprofileswapping.png" alt = "swapping between profiles">
            </p>

            <p>
                Another difference is how the output is laid out. Like I mentioned previously, the Zenmap out is chopped 
                up into multiple tabs – the Nmap output itself, port/hosts data, host details, and scan history and topology.<br><br>
                The nmap output is just the usual nmap output, nothing is different.<br><br>
                Ports/Hosts display all the port information found in a neat format<br>
                <img src="images/zenmapportshosts.png" alt = "zenmap ports/hosts page">
            </p>
            <p> The topology tab tries to build a (visual) network topology based off the scan results (of a host discovery scan).<br>
                <img src="images/zenmaptop.png" alt = "zenmap topology page">
            </p>

            <p>
                And finally the host details contains information about all hosts scanned<br>
                <img src="images/zenmaphostdetails.png" alt = "zenmap host details page">
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, I recommend you take a look at Zenmap but primarily use Nmap. This is because many 
                exploits and tools are command line based and the quicker you get to using the command line 
                the better. <br>This is because when it comes to using tools on a victim machines you are remotely 
                connected to, you won’t be able to run GUI tools like Zenmap.

            <p>
                Wget and cURL are both tools used to transfer data to and from servers online. <br>They are commonly 
                used in penetration testing to download files from a web server (for example downloading backup 
                files that should not have been available online).
            </p>
            <div><pre><code> wget filebackup | curl filebackup </code></pre></div>

            <p>
                Here is a comparison of the two. When curl finishes transferring, it outputs to the screen the 
                file content (so if it downloads a webpage it outputs the source code etc.).<br> Outside of this 
                they have small differences (the biggest one being wget mostly works over FTP and HTTP).<br>
                <img src="images/wgetcurl.png" alt = "running wget and curl">
            </p>

            <p>
                Both commands can use arguments but for now I recommend skipping over it as you wont use them often (for now). 
                As such, the arguments are out of 
                this guides scope , just using the barebones of the 
                command should be enough. <br><br>Both tools have a help page in case you wish to take a look at the arguments.
            </p>
            <div><pre><code> wget -h | curl -h </code></pre></div>

            <p>
                Truth be told, they both do the same thing. However, there are some cases were one tool works but the other does not. 
                <br><br>Because of this I recommend remembering both of them (preferably starting with the wget command and if that fails 
                switching to curl). <br><br>As they are both simple commands, they are easy to remember and can possibly save you if you’re in a tight spot.

            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;" id="metasploit">Honourable mention - Metasploit</h3>
            <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>

            <p>
                Metatsploit is an extremely powerful tool/framework that is considered one of the most widely used resources. 
                It’s considered the ‘all-in-one’ tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Metasploit can be used to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Scan a target</li>
                    <li>Find a vulnerability</li>
                    <li>Find a exploit tool/program within Metasploit that can work against said vulnerability</li>
                    <li>Execute the exploit with ease to compromise the vulnerability</li>
                    <li>If the compromise is successful, can then proceed to do additional attacks, such as privilege 
                        escalation attacks, changing from user to root user.</li>
                </ul>
                Summed up, Metasploit can do the entire exploitation process for you, with you doing the bare minimum work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason why I have not included Metasploit in this guide is because Metasploit does most of the work for you, 
                thus you would not be learning anything from it. <br>Many recruiters also like to test individuals to exploit 
                vulnerable services without Metasploit, so it would be best not to become too reliant on it. <br><br>This does not 
                change the fact Metasploit is a powerful tool, one you should take a look at once you become more proficient 
                in penetration testing. <br>I have kept Metasploit in the VM if you wish to have a look at it. To run Metasploit enter ‘msfconsole’.

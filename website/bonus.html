        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            1.	Sometimes when developers make a webpage they leave behind comments to outline key features, stating what this block of code does etc. <br>
            Sometimes comments containing important information are left behind.<br> 
            A link has been hidden in this page, can you find it? <!-- The top secret link is here! localhost:1001/avdsecvfret22fold13er/-->
        </h4>
        <hr>

        <!-- Button used to show and hide hints. This appears frequently-->
        <button onclick="showqQ1H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q1hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: Look at the page source. Often its ‘right click -> view page source’. </p>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          2. Following up from the previous task, access the link. It should take you to a directory. <br>
          What file can be found in this directory?
        </h4>
        <hr>

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">
            2.1	Using nmap and/or nikto, could you find this directory?
          </h5>
  

        
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            3. Enter the page found. It contains some hashed values, what type of hash is it?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <button onclick="showqQ3H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>
        <div id="q3hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: you can find a hash identifying website on google</p>
        </div>

            4. Revert the hashed values back to plaintext
        </h4>
        <hr>



        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          5.On this virtual machine, a port has been opened up. Accessing the port through the browser reveals a root terminal. <br>
          Using nmap, can you find this port?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            NB: When scanning with nmap, look for TTYD. Also, dont forget your arguments!
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          6.Once you have found the port, look at the source code of the nmap (or nikto) page in this guide website. <br>
          Does the embedded terminal frame match what you found?

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
         10. If I wanted to look at a deleted page, what website would I use?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: This website is commonly used outside of just penetration testing!
        </p>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          11. Name a popular vulnerability database

        12.	In this scenario, you are part of an organisation hired to do a penetration test. <br>
        When investigating a client’s server, you detect a vulnerability, however it is out of scope. What do you do?
        </h4>
        <hr>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
        13.	Following on from task 12, as you are investigating a client’s server you’ve notice the client has been undergoing illegal activity 
        (for example, found evidence of illegal images on the servers). What do you do?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
        NB: although this task is off track, it is possible you may find yourself in a situation in the future so it’s a nice to know.
        </p>

        
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
         14. Using the answer to task 10, what was the last Tweet @realDonalTrump sent before getting suspended?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: Admittedly, he was very active in sending tweets so getting around one of his last Tweets is also fine. <br>
          Also, consider the date he got suspended when looking

        1.	A link has been hidden in this page, can you find it?
      </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The answer may vary depending on what browser is being used, commonly the page source can be viewed by right clicking and selecting 
        ‘view page source’, or the shortcut ‘Crtl+U’. <br>
        <img src="images/other1viewpagesource.png" alt = "View page source">
      </p>

      <p>
        After looking through you can find the link. The directory is called 'avdsecvfret22fold13er'.<br>
        <img src="images/other1viewpagesource2.png" alt = "view page source in detail">
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can press F12 to open the inspector console, and you can read the source code through that.<br>
         I do not recommend reading the source code like this though, it’s not very spacious.
         <br>
        <img src="images/other1inspectelement.png" alt = "inspect element">
      </p>

      <hr>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
        2. Following up from the previous task, access the link. It should take you to a directory. <br>
        What file can be found in this directory?
      </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        A file called ‘testingpage.html’ can be found.<br>
        <img src="images/other2findingpage.png" alt = "Finding the testing page">
      </p>

      <hr>
      <h5 style="text-align: center;" >
        2.1. Using Nikto, could you find this directory by scanning the website?
      </h5>

      <p>
        No you wouldn’t due to the random name of the folder. 
        You could also use a directory scanning tool, like dirb, to increase the possibility of finding the directory.
      </p>

      <hr>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
      3. Enter the page found. It contains some hashed values, what type of hash is it?
      </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The contents of the page is the following:<br>
        <img src="images/other3page.png" alt = "testingpage contents ">
      </p>
      <p>
        The hash is SHA1<br>

      </p>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            4.	Revert the hashed values back to plaintext
        </h4>
        <hr>

        <p>Note – some websites only identify the hash, they don’t revert it. As such I have used another website to demonstrate this.</p>

          <p>The value is p@$$w0rd<br>

            5. On this virtual machine, a port has been opened up. 
            Accessing the port through the browser reveals a root terminal. <br>Using nmap, can you find this port?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>       
            With the following command 
        </p>
        <div><pre><code> nmap -p- -A localhost</code></pre></div><br>
        <p>The following can be found<br>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            6. Once you have found the port, look at the source code of the nmap (or nikto) page in this guide website. 
            Does the embedded frame match what you found?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            From looking at the source code of the Nmap page, this can be found for the terminal:<br>
          <img src="images/other6terminal.png" alt = "Terminal HTML code">

        </p>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
        7. And to verify your findings, try to access the port you found through the browser
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Upon accessing the port, the terminal can be found.

        8. Using the internet, can you identify the default credentials for the Arris DG860A wireless router?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The username is admin, the password is password<br>
            The URL to the page is here: <a href="https://www.cleancss.com/router-default/Arris/DG860A">https://www.cleancss.com/router-default/Arris/DG860A</a><br>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          9. What’s the difference between a black box and white box test?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The main difference between black box and white box test is the availability of information provided to the penetration tester 
            before the test has begun.<br> <br>
            For example, in a white box test the tester may get told detailed information about the client’s servers, 
            such as what services they are running, all the IP addresses being used etc. <br><br>
            Black box on the other hand is where the penetration tester is kept in the dark and not told any information at all.<br><br>
            They may not even be given an IP address, they may only be told to just investigate company xyz. 
            Because of this perspective, the penetration tester is like a real attacker in a black box.
             <br> Information like out-of-scope targets will still be provided to the tester for legal reasons. <br>

           10. If I wanted to look at a deleted page, what website would I use?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            You would use a website (like) the waybackmachine. Using the waybackmachine you can find deleted pages.<br>
             Under certain circumstances, you may even find sensitive deleted files/pages (that someone accidentally uploaded then proceeded to delete).<br>

         11.	Name a popular vulnerability database
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The two most popular vulnerability databases are ExploitDB and NVD. For more on ExploitDB check out the ExploitDB page.

            NVD (national vulnerability database) is owned by the US government and is basically a big library full of CVEs and its CVSS scoring (severity scoring).

            12.	In this scenario, you are part of an organisation hired to do a penetration test.
            When investigating a client’s server, you detect a vulnerability, however it is out of scope. What do you do?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            You should contact the client and bring it up with them. They will either say leave it (and possibly have it investigated in a future test) 
            or exploit it. <br>
            If they say exploit it, the scoping contract (made before the penetration testing starts) will need to be amended to take this 
            activity into consideration (or at the very least be put on the record so the client is well aware they told you to investigate it).

            13.	Following on from task 12, as you are investigating a client’s server you’ve notice the client has been undergoing illegal activity 
            (for example, found evidence of illegal images on the servers). What do you do?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            As the client is not above the law, the authorities will need to be contacted. If you do not act upon it and it was later found 
            you kept silent about it you may also suffer legal consequences, and as such it would be best to get into 
            contact with someone regarding your findings.

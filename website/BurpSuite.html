            <p>
              Burp Suite is a excellent multipurpose tool, itâ€™s main usage is a proxy interception tool, sitting 
              between your device and the target domain and intercepting HTTP requests and response. In addition 
              to this it can also do many things such as spider (discover) directories in a website to being used 
              as a brute forcing tool. There is also a premium/paid version of brute force that allows the 
              usage of extensions! <br><br>In this guide I will look at using Burp Suite as an intercept tool and going 
              over the common features Burp Suite has to offer (including intercepting and also brute forcing). 
              <br><br>Interception consists of interrupting the transfer of the HTTP message between the host and target. 
              When interrupted we then have the opportunity to alter the contents of the HTTP message (we can edit 
              or remove values in the message, for example change the password fields and then continue to send it off).

            <p>
              One way (and the simplest way) to open the tool is to click on the Burp Suite icon on the left hand side on the bar.

            <p>
              Alternatively it is also possible to open up Burp Suite through the console if you are missing the shortcut. The 
              command can be found in the text file on the desktop.

            <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>
            <p>
              Burp Suite allows you to either intercept with your browser or with its inbuilt browser. Previously, I used to
              use my own browser (this required a lot of configuration to be used properly) but I found the inbuilt 
              browser to be much better. <br><br> 
              For the purpose of demonstration I have covered setting up Burp Suite for external browsers, however 
              I recommend using the inbuilt browser within Burp Suite because its much easier to use, literally no 
              configuration required.
            </p>

              <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;" id="IntB1"><u>Through the inbuilt browser:</u></h4>
              <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>

              <p>
                Starting from the Burp Suite dashboard, move your mouse to the tabs to the top. Select either the â€˜proxyâ€™ 
                tab:
              <img src="images/btab1.png" alt = "Opening Burp browser 1" > </p>
              
              <p>
                Then on either page select the open browser button â€“ either from the left or topside within the tab <br>
                <img src="images/btab2.png" alt = "Opening Burp browser 2" height="450">
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon selecting open browser, the Burp Suite browser opens up.
              </p>

              <p><img src="images/btab3.png" alt = "Opening Burp browser 3" height="500"></p>

              <p>We can test it works by going to localhost and seeing if Burp Suite gets populated by intercepts. Upon 
                entering localhost come to proxy, successfully got an intercept</p>
              <p><img src="images/btab4.png" alt = "Opening Burp browser 4" height="330"></p>

              <hr>
              <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;" id="IntB2"><u>Through an external browser:</u></h4>
              <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>
              <p>
                If you want Burp Suite to run through your own browser you need to do a lot more configurations. 
                I also found the external browser doesnâ€™t always  work, so I recommend only looking at this if you're interested
                in the process.
              </p>

              <!-- Button to show/hide example-->
              <button onclick="showEx()">Show/Hide external browser config</button>

              <div id="baseset" style="display: none;">

                <p>
                  In proxy tab go to options. Ensure the interface is 127.0.0.1:8080, change it to 127.0.0.1:8081 
                  (this step can be skipped, I put it in case you  have some issues keeping it on 8080).

                  <p>
                    Next, go to your browser (I have used Firefox) and go to the menu button in the top left, 
                    then settings. Once in, use the search bar and look for network settings.<br>
                      <img src="images/bexset1.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser settings 1" height="500" >
                      <img src="images/bexset2.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser settings 2" height="200">
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In manual proxy configurations enter 127.0.0.1 and the port number you selected <br>
                    Tick the box to use it for https as well<br>
                    <img src="images/bexset3.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser settings 3" height="700" >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now we need the Burp Suite certificate. Next, go to the URL bar and enter http://burpsuite and click
                    the certificate in the top right to download it. As this is my second time setting it up, I already had a 
                    cacert, so I got another one (giving me cacert(1)). <br>
                    <img src="images/bexca1.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser CA 1"  >
                    <img src="images/bexca2.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser CA 2" >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back to the settings page, return to the search bar and look for certificates this time. Click 'view
                    Certificates'<br>
                    <img src="images/bexca3.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser CA 3" >
                    <img src="images/bexca4.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser CA 4" >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the â€˜Authoritiesâ€™ tab, select the â€˜Importâ€¦â€™ button. Then go to where you downloaded the certificate, 
                    and select the certificate. If you canâ€™t see it, make sure you turn on all files (from selecting the drop
                    down in the bottom right). In this case I will be selecting cacert(1).<br>
                    <img src="images/bexca5.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser CA 5" height="700"><br><br>
                    And in the 'Downloading Certificate' screen, make sure both CA trust boxes are ticked - it's needed for 
                    Burp Suite to work. <br>
                    <img src="images/bexca6.png" alt = "BurpSuite external browser CA 6" >
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As you can see, using the inbuilt browser is much easier than setting up an external browser. 
                    Especially when they both do the same thing.

            <p>
              In the <b>target</b> tab the site map can be found. This contains the structure of the websites visited, highlighting 
              all directories, files and pages found. The HTTP response and request can also be found in the middle. 
            <br>
            <img src="images/btarget.png" alt = "BurpSuite target" height="700" > </p>

            <p>
              Here is the sitemap from logging into the DVWA website. The sitemap feature 'spiders' the site (in the premium version) 
              and shows the path of all pages found. <br>
              Notice how some files are greyed out. Burp Suite know they exist, it just hasn't accessed it
              <br>
            <img src="images/btargetd.png" alt = "BurpSuite target sitemap" > </p>

            <p>
              The <b>inspector</b> tab on the right simplifies the HTTP request and outlines key information a user may be interested in. <br> <br>
              For example from 
              the DVWA login page request it organizes the cookies into its own tab, identifying the php session ID (which can 
              be used in a attack for session high jacking) and the sites security level. <br>Later on when I showcase brute 
              forcing the site the password and username fields can also be seen.
            <br>
            <img src="images/btargeti.png" alt = "BurpSuite target inspector" > </p>

            <p>
              Burp Suite also has the ability to add a target in (and out of scope), only showing the relevant addresses. By 
              right clicking the host you can add it to the scope list (as well as among other things like compare it 
              to the sitemap of another host). In doing so Burp Suite will then only log whats within the scope. This helps reduce clutter.
            <br>

            <p>
              The address entered into scope can then be seen in the scope tab. You can also enter scope through this page as well.<br>
              And just as how you can put targets into scope, you can also explicitly ignore certain targets as well by putting it in 
              â€˜exclude from scopeâ€™.

            <p>
            The <b>issue definitions</b> tab is used in conjunction with the issue advisory section in the dashboard. This is where 
            the relevant information is stored.

            <p>Considered the most important tab, due to being able to seen intercepted requests.</p>
            <p>
              When a HTTP request is intercepted, it can be found in the <b>proxy</b> area (in the intercept tab). HTTP requests are 
              sent whenever anything is done in the browser â€“ such as changing pages, clicking on a link, submitting a form, 
              entering log in information etc. <br><br>Here is an example of me using my proxy browser to access DVWA:
            <br>
            <img src="images/bproxy.png" alt = "BurpSuite proxy" height="350"></p>

            <p>
              The forward button can be clicked to push the request through, drop to delete it. You can also write in it
            <br>
            <img src="images/bproxy1.png" alt = "BurpSuite proxy changing 1" >
            <img src="images/bproxy2.png" alt = "BurpSuite proxy changing 2" ><br>
            By changing the fields in the HTTP request form you can also change the response you would normally get. For 
              example you could change your session id to someone elseâ€™s and you may log in as them. We will use this page later to 
            brute force the login.</p>

            <p>
              In this page you can also right click the HTTP request to see a set of options:<br>
            <img src="images/bproxylist.png" alt = "BurpSuite proxy set of options" ><br>
            The most important functions right now are the send to x options. This allows you to copy and paste the 
            HTTP request into the other tabs.<br> By moving the request into the intruder tab you can attempt to brute 
            force pages for example.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>HTTP history</b> has the history of the requests. Knows if itâ€™s a request you edited earlier etc. useful if you 
            need to look back at a request you dealt with previously instead of having to try and force it again.
          <br>
          <img src="images/bproxyhist.png" alt = "BurpSuite proxy HTTP History" height="300"></p>

          <p>
            There is also a tab called, Websocket history, which records history of traffic between web socket and app. 
            Will ignore it in this guide as not used often. This is what can be found on the page if you go onto it:
          <br>
          <img src="images/bproxysock.png" alt = "BurpSuite proxy Web Socket screen" ></p>
          
          <p>
            There is also an <b>options</b> tab, containing the rules for interceptions and more. It allows you to select proxy listeners 
            and filer client request, as well as server response. <br>Can also be configured to automatically modify certain parts 
            of the response. Also has other settings that can be played with â€“ for now I will leave it alone to prevent 
            confusion, it is worth a look though.

            <p>
              The <b>intruder</b> tab is where the brute force based activities occur. This is what it looks like in full: 
            <br>
            <img src="images/bintruder.png" alt = "BurpSuite Intruder"  ></p>

            <p>
              The intruder tab mostly consists of getting the request from the proxy tab, highlight the areas where the 
              payloads should be placed (normally the password and username field) and when done uses a wordlist and cycles 
              it into the payload field and try out all possible combinations. The successful response can normally be 
              identified by having a different length size compared to the failed response (e.g. failed response = 200 
              length, successful response = 212 length). I will present an example of using the intruder page later.
            </p>
            
            <p>Four types of attacks can be executed - Sniper, Battering ram, Pitchfork and Cluster bomb <br>
              <img src="images/bintrudertypes.png" alt = "BurpSuite Intruder types of attacks" ><br>
              The sniper attack is the most common type of attack, this is often used when you know what the username is but donâ€™t 
              know the password so you use a password wordlist (which is a very large file containing many commonly used passwords) 
              and enter every individual password with the username.<br><br>
              The cluster bomb is the second most common attack, its usually used to brute force a websites login page if the 
              username and password is unknown. It enables the use of two payloads at once instead of a single one, enabling the use 
              of a password wordlist and username wordlist.       
            </p>

            <p>
              The <b>payload</b> page is where the payload is loaded in. you can either load in a file containing a list of 
              usernames and passwords (or other fields) or manually type it in. Depending on what attack you select, 
              additional payload fields may appear (I.E. a box for payload 1, a box for payload 2).
              <br>

            </p>
            <p>
            The resource pool tab allows you to group tasks together and make them share a quota of resources. 
            Each pool can then also be configured so they can have delays, run requests concurrently etc.
            <br> This page isnâ€™t often used unless you are doing wide scale tasks and as such I would ignore it for now.

            <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>
            <p>The repeater tag is a page that has two panels â€“ the request and response panel.

            <p>
              Its intended use is to be used as a sort of side by side comparison for a HTTP requests and its response. 
              When a HTTP request is sent its response can be seen on the right, however the HTTP request remains. 
              This allow you to quickly make changes to the HTTP request to try and get a new response. <br><br>
              It is commonly used in activities such as SQL injection or just to quickly change field content (quickly enter passwords).<br>
              I will present an example of using the repeater page later.

            <p>
              In order to use the intruder tab, you must first get a HTTP request containing fields you want to 
              brute force. In this example I will use DVWA bruteforce page. You can try it yourself by following the steps
              In the <a href= DVWA.html>services page</a> on this site.
            </p>
            <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;"><u>Getting the HTTP Requst</u></h4>
            <p>
              First I opened the Burp Suite inbuilt browser and turned off the intercept option (this was so I didnâ€™t intercept any HTTP requests as I got to the page).<br> 
              I then went to the DVWA site and onto the Brute Force section.
              <br><img src="images/bintexoff.png" alt = "Burp Suite Intruder intercept off" >
              <br> I then entered a random password into the password field. I knew there was a user called admin so I 
              entered admin into the user field. I then went back into Burp Suite to re-enable the intercept option, 
              and then pressed the login button on the DVWA page.
              <br>
              <img src="images/bintex1.png" alt = "Burp Suite Intruder example 1" ></p>
            <p>
              Back to the Burp Suite application, a HTTP request was then intercepted and can be seen in the proxy tab (if this 
              request cannot be seen just press the â€˜forwardâ€™ button to push through some requests). <br><br>
              Eventually, a HTTP request containing the username and password fields can be seen, with what I entered. 
              This can also be seen in the inspectors tab.
              <br>
              <br><img src="images/bintex2.png" alt = "Burp Suite Intruder example 2" height="400" ><br><br>
              I then right clicked the page and selected â€˜send to intruderâ€™.<br>
              <img src="images/bintex3.png" alt = "Burp Suite Intruder example 3" ><br><br>
              The HTTP request was then moved to intruder.<br>

            <p>
              For this attack, I only want to Brute Force the password, so I made sure the attack type was set to sniper. 
              I then pressed the clear button to delete all brute force parameters
              <br>
              <img src="images/bintclear.png" alt = "Burp Suite Intruder clear button" ></p>

            <p>
              I then selected the password field (containing the test data I entered earlier â€˜testâ€™) and selected 
              the add button to re add the parameters to the password field.

            <p>
              I then switched to the payloads page and loaded up a text file called â€˜passwords.txtâ€™. This was a short password file 
              I made (in practice you will use a significantly larger password file, such as rockyou.txt, but for now I will use 
              this to decrease the size of the result).<br>

            </p>

            <p>
              I then pressed the start attack button in the top right and the Brute Forcing process began. <br>
              <img src="images/bintbf.png" alt = "Burp Suite Intruder brute forcing"><br>
              If you have the free version the brute forcing is a lot slower, but as I used a small wordlist the process 
              finished very quickly.

            <p>
              With the brute forcing complete, I looked at the response of the first password (by double clicking it and 
              clicking on the response tab) and scrolled down to see the password and username field. <br><br>
              Within it I saw a failed 
              response, so I deemed any request with the same length as that payload (4532) would be an incorrect password 
              and disregarded them.

            </p>

            <p>
              From spending more time looking at the length of the brute forcing, I noticed one of the payloads (the payload 
              that used â€˜passwordâ€™ as the password) had a larger length then the rest, meaning it gave a different response to the usual fail. <br>
              You can also click on the length tab to reorder by descending or 
              ascending lengths.

            <p>
              I went into the â€˜passwordâ€™ payload to look at the response and success message. From 
              looking at the HTTP content, a success message was found.

            <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;"><u>Getting the HTTP Requst</u></h4>
            
            <p>
              First I got the HTTP request for the login page again (see intruder example for how to get it). <br>This time I used a 
              different method to get the request â€“ as I had already been to the page it could be found in the sitemap. 
              <br>
              <img src="images/brsitemap.png" alt = "Burp Suite Repeater sitemap " height="650">
            </p>
            <p>
              I then right clicked and selected â€˜send to repeaterâ€™, moving it to the repeater tab.
              <br><img src="images/brtorep.png" alt = "Burp Suite Repeater sitemap 2">
              <img src="images/br1.png" alt = "Burp Suite Repeater example 1">

            <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;"><u>Using Repeater</u></h4>
            <p>
              The password I used previously was â€˜testâ€™. I changed the password to â€˜abcâ€™ to 
              go and see what response I would get, and pressed send.
              <br>
              <img src="images/br2.png" alt = "Burp Suite Repeater example 2" height="700">
              <br>
              As expected, it was a failure. However the HTTP request on the side still remains so 
              I tried again but this time with the password as â€˜passwordâ€™, and sent it off again.
              <br>
              <img src="images/br3.png" alt = "Burp Suite Repeater example 3">
              <br>
              This time a different, successful response can be seen.
            </p>

              As Burp Suite is not a traditional terminal tool, it does not have a man or help page like nmap does. It does however 
              have extensive documentation, and as itâ€™s been used by many people if you have an issue the solution is likely available on Google. <br>
              Here is a link to the full documentation page of Burp Suite.

              Burp Suite itself is considered to be a one of a kind jewel, however there is another tool on par with Burp Suite. 
              That is <b>OWASP ZAP</b>.
            </p>

            <p>OWASP ZAP is like a free version of Burp Suite Premium except it can do much more. One feature is ZAP 
              has the ability to completely attack a website by going into â€˜attack modeâ€™, finding vulnerabilities and 
              reporting back on them (and sometimes exploit them).
            </p>
            <p>
              The main reason why I didnâ€™t cover ZAP in this guide is because of the lack of documentation/guides. 
              If you get stuck with Burp Suite, you can easily find the answer out online because many people use it 
              and your issue would probably been answered in the past. <br><br>
              ZAP on the other hand would be more difficult and more akin to 
              a treasure hunt, and would most likely need to bugfix it yourself, which is an issue if you are just Starting
              to learn the tool. As ZAP also automates some part of the â€˜exploitation processâ€™, and so you may not fully understand 
              how to exploit a vulnerability properly which may negatively impact the learning process.
            </p>

            <p>
              I do recommend having a look at it at a later stage once you are more familiar with exploiting vulnerabilities.

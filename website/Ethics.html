            <p>
                Just like the legal side, ethics in penetration testing is also just as important from a moral point of view. The 
                difference between the law and ethics is breaking the law will result in legal consequences, however doing 
                something unethical may not. <br>But just because it won’t get you in trouble doesn’t mean you should do it!
            </p>
            <p>
                Just because you are curious in seeing what your family’s browsing history is doesn’t mean it would be right of 
                you to see what it is without their permission. <br>Respecting the privacy of others is important, you wouldn’t like 
                it if they looked at yours without your permission. Just because you are able to do something doesn’t mean you should.
            </p>
            <p>
                Misusing pen testing tools to fool around with someone’s computer, at the expense of another, should not be done at all 
                (unless it’s being done for practice, and you have the owner’s permission). Attacking a target you have permission for 
                is considered fine, ethically and legally.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the pen testing scene, normally if you do something unethical, what you are doing is probably also illegal. <br>For 
                example, logging into your friends Twitter without their permission to post a mean tweet would count as unauthorised 
                access in the computer misuse act. Depnding on the tweet content, they probably wouldn’t press charges though.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there are times when something can be ethical but also illegal. A recent example of this is during the 2022 
                Russian-Ukraine war, where Anonymous (and various other groups and unnamed countries) executed a cyber attacks against the Russian 
                Government, hacking and deleting sensitive files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are their actions legal? No.<br>
                Are their actions ethical? The answer will vary depending on who you ask, but for the majority yes – many would 
                justify it as retaliation against the atrocities of the Russian Government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this there are three types of hackers (terms like white hat are being moved away from to terms like ethical hacker): 
                <ul>
                    <li>white hat (legal hacker)</li>
                    <li>grey hat (‘true’ ethical hacker)</li>
                    <li>black hat (bad actor hacker)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                As long as you try to maintain a status as an ethical hacker, you will be fine (and you will be seen as an appealing 
                greenhorn by employers). <br>However, if retaining ethicality means breaking the law you must take another look at what 
                you are doing and see if what you are doing is truly ethical. Whether or not you continue is up to you.

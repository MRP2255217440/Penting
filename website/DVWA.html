          <p>
            DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) is a publicly available web application designed to be vulnerable. 
            It is a good starting point when it comes to learning how to use tools against an intentionally vulnerable service. <br>
            This page will provide activities to undergo against the DVWA website, mostly looking at Nmap, Burp Suite and Nikto.
        </p>  
        <hr>


        <!-- This is the start of the Questions-->

        <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;" id="Q"><u>Questions</u></h3>
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          1.	Find and access the DVWA port. Also state it's service version, and see 
          if any vulnerabilities can be found for the service by looking on Google.
        </h4>
        <hr>

        <p>
          Usually web services are hosted on port 80 or port 443. On this virtual machine I have changed the port location for DVWA. 
          Your first task is to find the port and access the DVWA site. <br> As a freebie hint, when you find what port 
          DVWA is running on add a colon after the IP address with the port number like so <br>
        <img src="images/dvwalocalhostport.png" alt = "localhost:xxx OR 127.0.0.1:xxx">
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, finding the service version is of little relevance, however if you are dealing with an out of date service 
          it will be important. This is because if it is of a certain version it may have certain vulnerabilities. Famous examples 
          include the Log4j vulnerability, Heartbleed and shellshock.
        </p>

        <div id="q1hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: Web Services are seen in nmap as HTTP</p>

            <div id="q1hint2" style="display: none;">

                <p>Hint 2: The port number may actually be above 1000, maybe even 10000!</p>
                <button onclick="showqQ1H3()">Click Me to show/hide hint 3</button>
                <div id="q1hint3" style="display: none;">

                    <p>Hint 3: I wonder if there is a way to make the scan show more information?</p>
                    <button onclick="showqQ1H4()">Click Me to show/hide hint 4</button>
                    <div id="q1hint4" style="display: none;">
                        <p> Hint 4: One piece of information collected when doing an nmap scan with a certain argument 
                            is the HTTP title.</p>

          1.1 (Optional) What operating system(s) versions did EternalBlue work against?
        </h5>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          2. When you get to the DVWA login page, can you guess the username and password?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>NB the credentials have been left unchanged</p>
        <button onclick="showqQ2H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q2hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1 – What password would a default admin have? Might be worth guessing</p>
            <button onclick="showqQ2H2()">Click Me to show/hide hint 2</button>
            <div id="q2hint2" style="display: none;">

                <p>Hint 2 – Often times default credentials can be found easily on the internet</p>

        </div>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          3. When logged in, change the security level in DVWA to low.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The tabs on the left will help.<br>
        NB this tasks needs to be done many times as DVWA frequently switches back to impossible security</p>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          4. On the DVWA site a interesting directory has been hidden. Using Nikto, can you identify the folder name?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>NB: You will find more than one interesting directory, the one we are interested in right now begins with S</p>

        
        <button onclick="showqQ4H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q4hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: Remember, entering ‘localhost’ does not work!</p>
            <button onclick="showqQ4H2()">Click Me to show/hide hint 2</button>
            <div id="q4hint2" style="display: none;">

                <p>Hint 2: Don’t forget to specify the port as well</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          5. Access the interesting folder (found in task 4) and download the wordlists present
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>NB: you can either use a tool or copy and paste the contents into a file</p>
        <p>
          As a freebie hint, when you move into a directory called ‘hello’ you go from localhost to localhost/hello
        </p>

        <button onclick="showqQ5H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q5hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: you could use either curl or wget to download the files</p>
            <button onclick="showqQ5H2()">Click Me to show/hide hint 2</button>
            <div id="q5hint2" style="display: none;">

                <p>Hint 2: if you wish to download the file through the browser, open the file and select CTRL + A and CTRL + C</p>

            </div>
        </div>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          6. With the wordlists downloaded (or copy and pasted), read the contents of the wordlists (through the console or 
          text editor).
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: This task is fairly simple, it’s just to make sure the wordlist was recovered intact
        </p>

        <button onclick="showqQ6H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q6hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: Linux ‘cat’ or a text editor like ‘geddit’ would be suitable. I have also provided ‘vim’, but 
              I do not recommend using it unless you have prior experience, just because it’s quite messy.</p>
        </div>
      

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          7. With the wordlists collected, the brute force setup can begin. <br>Using Burp Suite, intercept the 
          HTTP request for the DVWA Brute Force page (the tab on the left) after attempting to login as a random user 
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: Use the Burp Suite built in browser. Ensure security is still set to low. If for some reason the difficult gets stuck at
          'Impossible', go into the Chromium browser settings and reset the browser back to default.
        </p>

        <button onclick="showqQ7H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q7hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: The inbuilt browser can be opened in the ‘proxy’ tab. In the same tab, intercept can be 
              turned off until you get to the brute force page (so you don’t need to press ‘forward’ whenever you 
              change pages)</p>
              <button onclick="showqQ7H2()">Click Me to show/hide hint 2</button>
              <div id="q7hint2" style="display: none;">
  
                  <p>Hint 2: When you get onto the brute force page, don’t forget to turn the proxy back on and 
                    enter some test data so the HTTP request is generated</p>
                  <button onclick="showqQ7H3()">Click Me to show/hide hint 3</button>
                  <div id="q7hint3" style="display: none;">
      
                      <p>Hint 3: If you don’t see the HTTP request in Burp Suite (and you see a different request 
                        instead) press forward, if everything was done correctly it should show up (the request 
                        should contain your test data).</p>
      
                  </div>
              </div>
        </div>

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">
          7.1. In the proxy tab once the HTTP request was intercepted, what category can the ‘username’ and 
          ‘password’ category be found when looking at inspector? (Click the dropdown to see more).
        </h5>
        <br>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          8. With task 7 done, forward the HTTP request (the login page in chromium should give an error). <br>
          In the ‘HTTP history’ tab under ‘Proxy’, find the HTTP request you sent - it should also be accompanied 
          with a response. <br>What line can the login error message be found in the HTTP response? 
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: This is what the login page looks like if an incorrect login is added<br>
          <img src="images/dvwabruteforceloginfail.png" alt = "DVWA failed login">
        </p>

        <button onclick="showqQ8H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q8hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: Click the fields found to view the request (and if possible the response). If the 
              HTTP history gets messy, you can right click and select ‘clear history’ and enter more test 
              data into the login page.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          9. In Burp Suite, under the ‘Target’ tab go into ‘Site map’. This time find the Brute Force 
          page via the sitemap. <br>Select the page containing your test data if multiple pages can be seen. 
          <br>Once selected, go into ‘Response’ and find the error line again.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: this task is very similar to task 8. Click the folder dropdowns to reveal additional info.
        </p>

        <button onclick="showqQ9H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q9hint1" style="display: none;">
            <p>Hint 1: Folders/files that have been greyed out are areas you have not viewed, but Burp Suite knows exist.</p>
        </div>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          10. Using either task 8 or 9 to get to the HTTP request, send the HTTP request to the intruder tab.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          NB: Normally you would directly send the HTTP request to the intruder tab from the proxy intercept tab. The reason this 
          round about method was used was to get you to look at the sitemap and history tab (and in case you lose the HTTP request!).
        </p>

        <button onclick="showqQ10H1()">Click Me to show/hide hints</button>

        <div id="q10hint1" style="display: none;">

        </div>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          11. With the HTTP request in the intruder tab (task 10) and the wordlists recovered (task 5), the details for brute 
          forcing can now be setup. <br>Whilst in the intruder tab in ‘Positions’ (with the brute force login page HTTP Request 
          selected) remove all payload markers and only select the login credential fields as the payload position.

        </div>


        <h5 style="text-align: center;">
          11.1. In the HTTP request, an interesting parameter, a cookie, can be found. 
          <br>What is the name of the parameter, and how would we add it as a payload position (we wont need to)?
        </h5>



        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          12. With the payload position markers setup, the correct attack type now needs to be selected. <br>Under 
          ‘attack type’, read the type of attacks available and select the attack suitable for brute forcing the login page.

        1.	Find the DVWA port, the site and state the server version
      </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The port can be found by adding the –p- argument to the nmap scan.<br>
        <div><pre><code> nmap -p- localhost</code></pre></div><br>
        <img src="images/dvwa1a.png" alt = "running nmap with -p-"><br>
        Doing this however does not reveal the service, nor specifically which one is DVWA
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding –A to the command provides the additional information needed. It does however also produce a wall of text, but near 
        the bottom of the information, info regarding DVWA can be found, including the service version.<br>
        <img src="images/dvwa1b.png" alt = "running nmap with -A">
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apache server version was 2.4.41.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h5 style="text-align: center;" >
        1.1.	(optional) Find the Operating Systems versions EternalBlue worked against.
      </h5>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The main target of the EternalBlue are a range of Windows Machines, 2016 all the way to 2000. HTB has a machine called ’Blue’ 
        that is based off the EternalBlue exploit, it is a fairly simple box to exploit. TryHackMe also has a free alternative, 
        also just called ‘Blue’.<br>
        Here is the list to the Exploitdb site of an exploit found from just looking off Google:
        https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42315<br>
        <img src="images/dvwaoslist.png" alt = "eternal blue os list">

        2. What is the DVWA login credentials?
      </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The username is <b>admin</b>, the password is <b>password</b>. It was fine to use google to get the credentials, especially 
        since I used the default credentials for this purpose. In many companies default credetnials for services and admin accounts
        are often still used.<br>
        <img src="images/dvwacred.png" alt = "DVWA credentials online">
      </p>



      <hr>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
        3. When logged in, change the security level in DVWA to low.
      </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Navigate to the DVWA security tab, select the drop down and select 'low'.<br>
        <img src="images/dvwa3a.png" alt = "DVWA security page ">
      </p>
      <p>Besides the need to adjust the DVWA settings every time it resets, some systems actually work like this when it comes to 
        system security. This is why its important to ensure the admin account remains secure and not have it compromised in the
        first place.</p>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          4. On the DVWA site a interesting directory has been hidden. Using Nikto, can you identify the folder name?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Nikto with the host and port specified is enough to get the job done<br>
          <div><pre><code> nikto -host 127.0.0.1 -port 45080</code></pre></div><br>
          <img src="images/dvwa4a.png" alt = "DVWA nikto scan">
        </p>
        <p>From the results, a folder called ‘secret’ can be found. This is a folder I have made. If you find one out in 
          the wild, it will most likely contain information you’re not supposed to see!<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa4b.png" alt = "DVWA nikto scan 2"></p>
          <p>The other folders, tests and database are also very valuable. Tests may contain sensitive documents or forgotten 
            credentials, such as a long lost test user with admin credentials. As it is an ‘experimental’ user it may have 
            more permissions then the normal user. In this case it contains a file used to trim down on waste. Database files also
            have the same value as well.</p>



        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          5. Access the interesting folder (found in task 4) and download the wordlists present
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          First I went into the area of the interesting directory and found two wordlist files.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa5a.png" alt = "DVWA secret folder">
        </p>
        <p>I then proceeded to copy the URL to this page and added the file name to the end of it, so it looked like this.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa5b.png" alt = "DVWA nikto scan 2"><br>
          <img src="images/dvwa5c.png" alt = "DVWA nikto scan 2"></p>

          <p>I then copy and pasted the URLs into a curl command and added the –o operator to save the file on the VM.</p>
          <div><pre><code>curl localhost:45080/secret/passwords.txt -o passwords.txt  <br>curl localhost:45080/secret/usernames.txt -o usernames.txt </code></pre></div>
          <p><img src="images/dvwa5d.png" alt = "DVWA nikto scan 2"></p>
          <p>With that I then got the files on my VM to be used as a wordlist.</p>
                
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          6. With the wordlists downloaded (or copy and pasted), read the contents of the wordlists (through the console or 
          text editor).
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Simple enough, cat ‘filename’ is sufficient. Gedit could also be used<br>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
        7. With the wordlists collected, the brute force setup can begin. Using Burp Suite, intercept the HTTP request 
        for the DVWA Brute Force page after attempting to login as a random user.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          First open the Burp Suite browser by going into the proxy tab. I turned intercept off for the time being for convenience.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa7openbrowser.png" alt = "DVWA using Burp Suite to open the browser">
        </p>
        <p>
          Once on, using the Chromium browser navigate back onto DVWA (and logging back into DVWA) go onto the Brute Force page. Ensure security 
          is still set to low.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa7bruteforcetab.png" alt = "DVWA highlighted brute force tab">
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure intercept is turned back on and enter some test data.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa7bruteforce.png" alt = "DVWA entering data into the brute forcing system">
        </p>
        <p>
          If everything has been done correctly, a HTTP request should be intercepted by Burp Suite. The first line 
          should contain the test data. If it is not on the first line, the difficultly of DVWA is likely not set to low.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa7bruteforceHTTPreq.png" alt = "DVWA the brute force HTTP request">
        </p>

        <hr>
        <h5 style="text-align: center;" >
          7.1. In the proxy tab once the HTTP request was intercepted, what category can the ‘username’ and 
          ‘password’ category be found when looking at inspector? <br>(Click the dropdown to see more).
        </h5>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The username and password can be found in the request query parameters section of inspector.<br>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          8. With task 7 done, forward the HTTP request (the login page in chromium should give an error). <br>
          In the ‘HTTP history’ tab under ‘Proxy’, find the HTTP request you sent - it should also be accompanied 
          with a response. <br>What line can the login error message be found in the HTTP response? 
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The HTTP request in this case will most likely be the one with a tick mark in the ‘params’ field. It should also have a 
          longer URL (containing the username and password field).<br>

          9. In Burp Suite, under the ‘Target’ tab go into ‘Site map’. This time find the Brute Force 
          page via the sitemap. <br>Select the page containing your test data if multiple pages can be seen. 
          <br>Once selected, go into ‘Response’ and find the error line again.

        <hr>
        <p>
          The sitemap can be explored by clicking the dropdowns, revealing more folders and files. Folders that have

          Then highlight one of the credential fields by click and dragging over the data 
          (one of the fields containing the test data), then selecting 'Add'. The email address field (test data) 
          will then be marked as a payload and will look as such. It will also change colours<br>

          11.1. In the HTTP request, an interesting parameter, a cookie, can be found. What is the name of the parameter, 
          and how would we add it as a payload position?
        </h5>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The parameter is called ‘PHPSESSID’. If you had another users cookie, you could potentially use it 
          for a session hijacking attack. It can be selected as a payload position by following task 11, 
          selecting the cookie data itself and selecting the ‘Add’ button.<br>

          12. With the payload position markers setup, the correct attack type now needs to be selected. <br>Under 
          ‘attack type’, read the type of attacks available and select the attack suitable for brute forcing the login page.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The attack being done is called a ‘Cluster Bomb’.</p>
        <p>
          This attack type is being used because two separate payloads (wordlists) are being used for brute forcing – the 
          username and password list. Sniper attack could be used however it would take too long – it would go through all 
          the payload combinations (and so try the password wordlist in the username field, which would take up time).<br>

        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
        13. In the intruder tab under ‘payloads’, add the username wordlist to ‘payload set 1’ and the password wordlist to ‘payload set 2’.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>In this example, I will be adding the username wordlist.</p>
        <p>
          First ensure ‘payload set 1’ is selected. Once confirmed, select the ‘load’ button, 
          then select the file and press open <br>
          <img src="images/dvwa13loadingwordlist.png" alt = "DVWA Burp Suite loading username wordlist"><br>
          With that, the first payload is ready. <br>

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>


        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          14. With task 13 done, the intruder tab should now be setup to brute force the login page. <br>Double check 
          everything has been done correctly, then start the attack. <br>The aim of the attack is to find a successful 
          login credential.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Ensure the correct payload positions have been selected, the correct attack type, 
          the correct payload sets containing the correct word lists. Once confirmed, select start attack. <br>
          <img src="images/dvwa14startattack.png" alt = "DVWA Burp Suite start attack button">
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon starting the attack, a Burp Suite warning will appear regarding the use of the community version, ignore it. 
          Then a window like below will appear (and one by one the brute force response will be returned).<br>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          15. With the brute forcing complete, all that’s left to do is see the results. When brute forcing started a window should of opened
          (‘Intruder attack’). <br>Many of the brute force credential attempts responded with the length of ‘4532’. What type of 
          response was given to these credentials?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>First I selected a request with the length ‘4532’. Then I clicked on the response tab and scrolled through it. 
          When I got to line 85 I saw the error response.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa15bruteforcewindow.png" alt = "DVWA Burp Suite brute force window bad response">
        </p>
        <p>
          With this information I concluded that all of the responses with the length ‘4532’ are likely to be failed 
          attempts. This meant looking at them would pointless, and so can be ignored.
        </p>

        
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          16. With the establishment of responses with the length of ‘4532’ are most likely brute forcing attempts that failed, 
          they can be ignored. <br>Look for a request of another length.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>By clicking on the length column title, the table can be filtered by length highest to lowest (and 
          also lowest to highest), making finding other lengths much easier.<br>

        17. A second length, ‘4570’, was found. Investigate the HTTP response tab and look at what type of response was given.
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Repeat the steps taken in task 16, except this time for length '4750'. Upon investigating it, a 
          successful login was found<br>

          18. Using the payload content of the request containing the length ‘4570’, enter the credentials into 
          the login page. <br>Does it work, and what can be seen?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Using the following payload of the request with the length '4570' as the username and password:<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa18credentials.png" alt = "DVWA Burp Suite brute force window correct credentials">
        </p>

          19. Back to DVWA, navigate to the SQL Injection page, and try out the Injection page by entering numbers and looking at the response.<br> 
          Once familiar with it, repeat the past tasks to acquire a HTTP request. Once acquired, send the HTTP request to REPEATER

          Tab can be found on the left just like before, this time below brute force. Remember to keep security at low.
          The following page should show up. Have a play around with the field found, take a look at the

        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          The ID field can be found as so on the first line. If it is not found here then it most likely means the incorrect security setting is being used.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa20enteringidinrepeater.png" alt = "DVWA changing user id in repeater">
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the request is sent look at the response tab and look for the response from the website. If the ID exists names should be seen.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa20idrepeaterresponse.png" alt = "DVWA looking through repeater response"><br>
          Repeat the process for the other user IDs, looking at those responses as well.

        <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
          21. Return to the DVWA page, enter a SQLi query into the ID field to present all the user IDs on the page (make sure intercept is turned off)    
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Enter 1' or 1=1# into the ID area like so, and the following IDs will be seen<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa21listofids.png" alt = "DVWA list of all responses">
        </p>
        <p>
          Broken down, the apostrophe (') closes out the SQL query early. What follows next is a True statement (or 1=1), which will always be true.<br>
          This results in the database then reporting back all user IDs. The hash (#) is used to escape the statement early, cutting the rest of the query off.

        </p>


        <h5 style="text-align: center;">
          21.1. Use the same command for task 21 again, except this time insert it directly into the HTTP request in the repeater page (in the ID field). 
          Does it work?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Copy and paste the same command into the HTTP request we left in the repeater tab. Paste it into the ‘id’ parameter.<br>
          <img src="images/dvwa21sqlinhttp.png" alt = "DVWA attempting to do SQL through Burp Suite"><br>
          An error is received this time. The reason for this error is because the query had not been encoded properly<br>

        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">
          22. Repeat task 21, but this time turn the intercept on. Compare the HTTP Request received from task 21 and compare it to 21.1. <br>
          Afterwards, send the HTTP Request to repeater and send it forward, does it work this time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Now the query appears in the proper, encoded manner. <br>
          You can find the encoded values here, as well try out encoding URL: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">

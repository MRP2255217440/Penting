            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"id="General"><u>What is ExploitDB</u></h3>
            <p>
                ExploitDB (also known as exploit database) put simply is a very large database of exploits. When a vulnerability is 
                found, people will make programs to exploit those vulnerabilities. Once the exploitation program is created, they 
                may then proceed to upload the program onto the internet. <br><br>ExploitDB is one of those hubs holding a collection of 
                exploits (users are able to upload their own exploitation programs to ExploitDB). The database on ExploitDB 
                contains exploits dating all the way back to 1988 (with some papers extending to 1984), showing you the size of 
                exploits available on the site (and how long vulnerabilities have been around for).<br><br>

                The ExploitDB site itself is well made and easy to use. The intended use of ExploitDB is to use the search feature 
                to look for specific vulnerabilities you have found. <br><br>Once you find an appropriate exploit for the accompanying 
                vulnerability, you can then download and execute it for exploitation. You can use the search feature to find the 
                exploits, however commonly I type it into Google and find the ExploitDB page myself. <br><br>

                Many other tools also use the exploit database available on ExploitDB, Nmap ‘vulscan’ for example gives users a 
                list of potential exploits reflecting on the scan result, with the exploits coming from multiple databases (with 
                ExploitDB being one of them).

                The main fields you will most likely use will be title, platform and type. If you have the CVE available I also 
                recommend using it, as its basically a vulnerability ID. It also has checkmarks. 
                <ol>
                    <li>Verified – tells you if the exploit has been verified to be working by EDB themselves</li>
                    <li>Has application – the exploit works against a specific vulnerable application</li>
                    <li>No Metasploit – if the exploit is not on Metasploit tool</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h4 style="padding-left: 10px;"><u>What is a CVE?</u></h4>
            <p>
                CVE stands for ‘common vulnerabilities and exposures’. It is basically a identification code given to each 
                vulnerability found. For example, the EternalBlue CVE is 2017-0144. The CVE is in the format of Year discovered 
                – ID_Number.<br><br>
                Trying looking the EternalBlue CVE up on Google! In the NIST CVE database, details about the CVE vulnerability can 
                be found, the details being the vulnerability description and severity.<br>

            <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>
            <p>
                First, depending on the information you have collected on the service you are looking for a exploit for, you 
                would enter what you know about the service (like its version) the into the fields. In this example I’m going 
                to look for the remote exploit for a Windows machine (EternalBlue exploit).<br><br>

                From the information I have gathered, I know the target is a Windows 7 machine. In the title I enter ‘windows 
                7’ (if you’re looking at apache vulnerabilities, you would enter apache version_x), with the platform as ‘Windows’.

            </p>
            <img src="images/edbsearchwindows.png" alt = "ExploitDB search windows" width="900">

            <p>
            This is the response received:<br>
            <img src="images/edbresponse1.png" alt = "ExploitDB Windows response " width="900"><br>
            I then decide I want to try out a remote exploit, so I entered ‘remote’ into type.<br>
            <img src="images/edbresponse2.png" alt = "ExploitDB Windows response 2 " width="900"><br>
            And now the EternalBlue exploit, the exploit I’m looking for, can be found at the top of the list.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"id="analysis"><u>ExploitDB Page analysis</u></h3>
            <a href="#Start" style="padding-left: 10px;font-size: 14px;">To Contents Table</a>
            <p>
            In this example I will be looking at the EternalBlue exploit 
            (can be found  <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42315">here on ExploitDB</a> )

            <img src="images/edbeternalblue.png" alt = "ExploitDB EternalBlue page" width="900" > <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>EBD-ID – this is the unique ID by EDB given to the exploit page<br>
                        <img src="images/edburl.png" alt = "ExploitDB EternalBlue URL"></li>
                    <li>CVE – the Common Vulnerability and exposure code – in this case its 2017-0144 to reflect 
                        its for the vulnerability ‘EternalBlue’</li>
                    <li>EBD verified – confirmation from EDB themselves whether or not the code actually works – in 
                        this exploit EDB has confirmed it works</li>
                    <li>Type – what type of exploit is it (for example, DOS, remote, local exploit) – in this case it’s type is 
                        ‘remote’ (meaning it can be remotely executed)</li>
                    <li>Platform – what platform the exploit works on – in this case, it works against Windows machines (and 
                        in the title, the Windows versions has been specified)</li>
                    <li>Date – the date of when the exploit was uploaded </li>
                    <li>Vulnerable application – if relevant, what vulnerable application the exploit works against – in this case 
                        nothing has been specified as the target is a range of Windows OS.</li>
                    <li>Code at the bottom – the code at the bottom is actually the exploit code itself. In this case, this is the 
                        code of the EternalBlue exploit. Regardless of what exploit you are using, you should ALWAYS read the code. 
                        It may contain instructions, or have some issues or malicious lines of code (this is why having an understanding
                        of programming is important in penetration testing!).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                ExploitDB is a treasure trove of exploits, 9 out of 10 times, if you are looking for an exploit it is highly 
                likely you will find and download it from ExploitDB. Many other tools also integrate the ExploitDB database 
                into its usage. An example of a tool is a Nmap script called ‘Vulscan’, which outputs relevant exploits based 
                off the scan results (coming from a range of databases, ExploitDB included).  Some exploits have also started 
                to popup on GitHub, however unless it is being regularly updated I believe it should be the same as its 
                ExploitDB counterpart.

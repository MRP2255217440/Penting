            <hr>
            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"><a href="DVWA.html"><b><u>DVWA</u></b></a></h3>
            <!-- DVWA overview-->
            <p>DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) is a vulnerable web service that I have downloaded online and set up on 
                this VM. <br><br>

                The service itself can be found on a port on this VM, you will need to find it using Nmap.
                <br><br>
                The service has already been configured by me. However you may need to create a new database the 
                first time you go onto the website (its a simply procedure, just click the create database button).
            </p>

            <p>
                DVWA is a learning tool designed to have many vulnerabilities. It contains a wide range of vulnerabilities 
                and has been designed to help teach users how to exploit them. <br>I have included a couple of my own 
                vulnerabilities/additions to help enhance the learning experience. DVWA is considered to be one of 
                the more popular vulnerable services and as such many other guides can be found surrounding it.<br> As 
                DVWA has a vast amount of vulnerabilities and exploits, I recommend looking at other guides for more 
                advanced exploits as this guide is for starters.

                <br><br>

                DVWA also shows users how to patch out the vulnerabilities that can be found by having a range of ‘difficulty’ 
                levels, in which the page with the vulnerability has be rewritten to have more secure code. <br><br>This would mean a 
                ‘low level’ exploit would not work against medium difficulty page for example. You can also compare the code 
                of different difficulty.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <!-- Bad Store overview-->
            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"><a href="BadStore.html"><b><u>BadStore</u></b></a></h3>
            <p>
                Bad Store is another vulnerable web service I have set up.
                <br><br>
                Unlike DVWA, I have setup Bad Store on its own separate VM. This means you will have to look for an IP address 
                as well as a port. <br>If you don’t know how to do this, look at the Nmap page. Refer to the Bad Store page for more specific information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bad Store is another learning tool filled with vulnerabilities. Unlike DVWA, however, Bad Store is more 
                reflective of a badly made website.<br><br> Although DVWA offered a more handholding experienced, Bad Store shows 
                a more practical ‘real life’ example of a vulnerable website. The closest Bad Store has to a giving help is a 
                manual that can be found, stating what exploits and vulnerabilities Bad Store has.

                <br><br>

                Bad Store demonstrates a range of vulnerabilities, however most of the vulnerabilities contained are more ‘bad 
                practice/policy in use’ rather than technical based (you will see what I mean when you play with it!). This 
                web service is an example of why you must follow good standards and good coding practices.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <!-- Mutillidae overview-->
            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"><b><u>Mutillidae</u></b></h3>
            <p>
              Mutillidae is another vulnerable web application added to Penting. Mutillidae runs off a Docker in order to host the 
              website and its vulnerable service. <br><br>
              Unlike DVWA and Bad Store, this vulnerable service was not covered in-depth in 
              this guide, and instead was included for the purpose of allowing users to have a go at exploiting a vulnerable 
              service blind. <br><br>Mutillidae contains inbuilt hints and tips, as well as a pathway and goes over how to exploit 
              some of its vulnerabilities, if you require the assistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to how Mutillidae has been setup, running DVWA and Mutillidae simultaneously is not possible and as such 
              DVWA needs to be turned off to allow Mutillidae to run.<br><br> Steps to configure Mutillidae has been included 
              in the text document found on the Penting desktop. <br>I recommend making a backup of the VM beforehand (this also 
              means if you wish to go back to DVWA you would not need to reconfigure DVWA if you make an error). 
              When configured, it can be found on port 80.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to vulnerable services like Bad Store and DVWA, I have also added a list of additional questions relating to penetration testing. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of these questions are the practical sorts, taking a look at vulnerabilities I have added to Penting.<br>
              Others are more text book based response questions, asking what you would do if situation xyz happened.
              Regardless, they are designed to be quick and easy to complete.

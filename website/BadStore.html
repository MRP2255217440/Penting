            <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"><u>General Info</u></h3>
            
            <p>
                Unlike DVWA, Bad Store is a virtual machine hosting a extremely vulnerable web site. <br>Just like DVWA, it 
                is also publicly available and designed to be vulnerable. <br><br>I have 
                chosen not to attach Bad Store onto the same virtual machine to help clean up the Nmap response (and to 
                try and simulate penetration testing an external target).<br><br>
                Bad store is a simple starting point for learning how to attack websites, some of the vulnerability’s Bad Store has to 
                offer are more non-technical, with some vulnerabilities being caused due to bad practices.<br><br>
                <b>Whenever you are using BadStore, you MUST run the BadStore VM at the same time. Otherwise you cannot find it. 
                    The BadStore folder can be found in the same location as the Penting folder.</b>
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;"><u>Setting up Bad Store</u></h3>
          <p>
          In case this is your first time setting up Bad Store and you cannot connect to it, 
          click here to see the instructions in case Bad Store is not working<br><br>
          If you are using Vbox, you will need to remake the BadStore VM. I have placed the BadStore ISO in the BadStore folder. <br>
          Warning: reading these instructions may spoil the answers for some of the tasks:<br>
          </p>

          <button onclick="showEx()">Click Me</button>

        <div id="setup" style="display: none;">
            <ol>
                <li> First run both BadStore VM and Penting VM<br><img src="images/badstore.png" alt = "BadStore setup" style="height: 800px;"></li>
                <li> Once on, check the IP address of Bad Store. This can be done using ifconfig. <br>
                    <div><pre><code> ifconfig</code></pre></div>
                    <img src="images/badstore2.png" alt = "BadStore setup 2">
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Then in Penting, go to the terminal try to ping the IP address of BadStore<br>
                    <div><pre><code> ping IP</code></pre></div><br>
                    <img src="images/badstore3.png" alt = "BadStore setup 3">
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are getting responses from the IP then it means you are connected. You can also double check it works 
                    by then trying the IP out on the website, though I wouldn’t because it may spoil the tasks.
                </li>
                    

            </ol>
        <p>If setting it up for Vbox, make sure you select the following settings:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/badv.png" alt = "BadStore settings 1"><br>

            1.	After turning on the Bad Store virtual machine, find out what it's IP address
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>
            NB: this task may require you to run ifconfig on the BadStore virtual machine if the 3rd section 
            of the IP address (192.168.section 3.1) has a different IP to the Penting VM. If this is the case adapt 
            the command and base it off the BadStore IP instead of Penting. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This task consists of finding the target on the network. In a real penetration test you may be explicitly told what the 
            target address is or what addresses to stay away from. <br>
            As a freebie hint, unlike DVWA, you will not be looking at localhost and instead at a 'normal' IP address.

            2. Using Nmap, scan the IP address revealed in task 1 and identify what port the web service is running on and its version. <br>Then proceed to
            access the website through the browser
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>Compared to DVWA, accessing the browser should be much easier this time.</p>

          <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            4. What file revealed the location of these directories, and how do you access that file? Also highlight where the issue is.

          <hr>
          <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            5.	Take a look at each of the interesting directories, one of them should have an even more interesting file.

            it resembles?
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>
            NB: When you realise what file these credentials may be from and its implications, these credentials should 
            definitely not be available.

            reset system. What do you notice?

          <hr>
          <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            8. If you haven't already, try to reset a random user’s password. <br>What do you

            9. The password reset system works based off entering a username and a password hint (giving the 
            user a hard coded password), which the password hint consists of a pool of 6 colours. <br>Based off this 
            information, make a password hint wordlist from the password hint dropdown menu.
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>
            NB: This task is fairly simply, but being able to make your own wordlists will be quite useful in the future.

            10. Just like with task 9, make a wordlist based off possible <b>admin</b>istration account names.
            It does not have to be large
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>
            NB: most of the time services may not actually bother changing the default name of admin accounts. 
            As you can probably guess, this is a huge security risk (one we will be exploiting)

            11. With the wordlists setup it’s time for the HTTP Request, use the inbuilt Burp Suite browser to access 
            Bad Store and head to the ‘my accounts’ page. <br>Using Burp Suite, intercept the HTTP request after entering 
            a random username as test data into the email address field.

            <b><u>WARNING</u></b> – When doing this task I  encountered some issues with connecting to the Bad Store site through 
            Burp Suite (but had no issue when accessing it through Firefox). <br>
            If you get an error message ‘No route to 
            host’ try restarting Bad Store and Penting, that fixed it for me. Also make sure you enter the correct IP!

          <div id="q11hint1" style="display: none;">
              <p>Hint 1: The inbuilt browser can be opened in the ‘proxy’ tab. In the same tab, intercept can be 
                turned off until you get to the password reset page (so you don’t need to press ‘forward’ whenever

            When you have the HTTP Request, forward it. 
             In the ‘HTTP history’ tab under ‘Proxy’, find the HTTP request you sent - it should also be accompanied 
            with a response. What line can the password reset message be found in the HTTP response?

            NB: Upon forwarding the HTTP Request, the password reset page in chromium should change to the page stating 
            ‘test data’ has its password reset to ‘Welcome’. This is what the page looks like after pressing ‘forward’.<br>

        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The page that mostly revealed the directories is robots.txt (files, like backup, would have been picked up by nikto anyway but 
          because it was stored in here it was found much easily). If the supplier directory however was not in robots.txt then it may 
          not have been detected by nikto.</p>
        <p>The page can be accessed through the browser by adding ‘robots.txt’ to the IP address. Many websites have a robots.txt file, it’s

          7. Now to look at the website. Enter the Bad Store IP address into the 
          URL. <br>Once in, navigate to the 'my account' page and read the information regarding the password 
          reset system. What do you notice?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>In order to change a users password, you only need the email address and a password hint. Not too bad so far but… <br>
          <img src="images/bad7passwordreset.png" alt = "bad store password reset page"></p>
        <p>
          The password hint only provides a selection of 6 choices, as opposed to using a user generated answer. 
          This makes it susceptible to brute force attacks (an attacker could use this list to reset a list of account passwords).<br>

          <br>What do you notice about the result of the password reset?
        </h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Regardless of what the user’s password hint and username was (look at the username I entered, it most definetly 
          does not exist), the password will always be reset to ‘Welcome’. This is a 
          <b>MAJOR</b> flaw in the system, this meant by just knowing the username (and guessing the hint) a random person could
          reset another users account. <br>

          <hr>
          <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            9. The password reset system works based off entering a username and a password hint (giving the 
            user a hard coded password), which the password hint consists of a pool of 6 colours. <br>Based off this 
            information, make a password hint wordlist from the password hint dropdown menu.
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>Use a text editor, like gedit, to manually enter the password hint colours into a text file<br>

            11. With the wordlists setup it’s time for the HTTP Request, use the inbuilt Burp Suite browser to access 
            Bad Store and head to the ‘my accounts’ page. <br>Using Burp Suite, intercept the HTTP request after entering 
            a random username as test data into the email address field.
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>First open the Burp Suite browser by going into the proxy tab. I turned intercept off for the time being for 
            convenience (wouldn’t need to continuously return to Burp Suite to forward every HTTP request when changing pages).<br>

          </p>
          <p>
            When turned on, navigate to the Bad Store IP address and onto the ‘my account’ page containing the password reset 
            system. When ready, turn intercept back on and enter some test data. If everything was done correctly, a HTTP Request
            should be intercepted by Burp Suite. The last line should contain the test data (and password hint colour).<br>

            12. When you have the HTTP Request, forward it. <br>In the ‘HTTP history’ tab under ‘Proxy’, find the HTTP request 
            you sent - it should also be accompanied with a response. <br>What line can the password reset message be found in 
            the HTTP response?
          </h4>
          <hr>
          <p>In this case, you can identify the HTTP request by the POST method, the URL, the parameter and the page title 
            (if you look at the HTTP request in task 11 you may notice on the first line its using a POST method and not GET).<br>

            (to line 100) and the password reset message can be found. As you can see, the password 
            is not auto generated and instead is hard coded.<br>

          <h4 style="text-align: center;" >
            13. In Burp Suite, under the ‘Target’ tab go into ‘Site map’. This time find the password reset page via the 
            sitemap. <br> Select the page containing your test data if multiple pages can be seen. Once selected, go into 
            ‘Response’ and find the password reset response line again.

          <p>The attack being done is called a ‘Cluster Bomb’.
            This attack type is being used because two separate payloads (wordlists) are being used 
            for brute forcing – the admin name and password hint list. Sniper attack could be used however it would 
            take too long – it would go through all the payload combinations (and so try the password hint wordlist 
            in the email address field, which would take up time).

            length different?
          </h5>
          <p>
            The reason for the different length is solely because of the size of the email address/username added (see above). 
            For example, look at the difference of the length between when payload 1 used root and when it used admin. 
            Root is one letter shorter than admin, and as such it always has a length shorter than admin by one.

            This time only assign a payload to the email field (and not the password, 
            so enter ‘Welcome’ into the password field instead). <br>
            Additionally, what attack type would we need to be done this time if only one payload was being used? <br>
            In the payload set, add the possible admin names word list.

            field and press the add button to turn it into a payload position. Don’t forget to change the ‘passwd’ field to 
            ‘Welcome’.

            For the attack type, snipe would be suitable. Technically speaking Battering ram would also work, 
            but since we are only working with a single payload position it would be more ‘elegant’ to stick with sniper.<br>

            25. Due to the sample size of the wordlists being used (my wordlist only used three words) it took longer to setup the brute 
            force process compared to manually entering the credentials.<br>
            As such, repeat task 19. This time, however, send the HTTP Request to repeater instead of Intruder.

          <p>Do the usual steps to get the HTTP Request (go to the page, turn intercept on, enter test data). Right click and send the Request to repeater.<br>

            <br>Then press send and look through the HTTP response to see if the credential received an error or ‘welcome to Bad Store’ reply.<br>
            If an error was given, move onto the next email  and repeat.

          <p>The HTTP request should look as so in the repeater tab. In the proposed username slot (the email) is where the possible word list names go.<br>

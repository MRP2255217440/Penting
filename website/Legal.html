            <p>
                When it comes to penetration testing, legality is extremely important to keep in mind. 
                This is because the only difference between a penetration tester and a hacker is 
                authorisation – attacking a target because you have been asked to is fine, doing it on 
                your own will isn’t. <br>In other words, if you attack a target you are not supposed to, you 
                are breaking the law. This includes targets that have a <b>very similar domain name or IP 
                address to what you have been asked to attack</b>. <br>This also extends to hosts owned by the 
                client you are testing for, and they have stated they do not want you to investigate (and 
                ports & services they have stated they do not want you to attack either). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, accidents can happen, but attacking the wrong target may result in jail time for you. 
                This is because you are still technically breaking the CMA – <b>you are accessing an 
                unauthorised machine</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before a penetration test begins, a <b>scoping contract MUST be made and signed</b>, preferably of 
                a high quality. <br><br>This document contains vital information about the test that needs to be 
                done – for example what targets you are allowed to attack, what you cannot do, who to 
                contact if an issue arises etc.
                <br><br>
                A client may hire you and state they want you to attack their web services on web servers 
                they are running (and may provide a set of ports and IP addresses), however may also 
                state they don’t want you anywhere near their database servers (and may provide a set 
                of ports and IP addresses they want you to ignore). 
            </p>
            <p>
                By having a clear scoping document, you can ensure you only attack the right targets and can 
                reliably blacklist anything to stay away from. <br>And if someone accuses you of wrongdoing, 
                you have the scoping document as evidence for proof of no maliciousness and you have permission to.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If you do not have proof of permission to test a target, WAIT FOR IT</b>. Attacking a target too early/before the 
                agreed time is also considered a breach of the scoping contract.
                <br><br>
                Some of this stuff may sound quite obvious but it's very important to understand properly.
                People have been imprisoned for things like this before, accidentally attacking the wrong target. 
                If it's happened to pros, why not you?

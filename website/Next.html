                In case you have finished the guide and wondering where to go next, look no further!<br><br>

            <!-- HTB overview-->
            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><a href="HTB.html"><b>HTB</b></a></h3>
            <p>HTB is a CTF based platform. This basically means – HTB throws a machine at you, your goal is to access 
                the machine and try to get a user account. <br>Once you’ve got the user account, you then try to get root. 
                I recommend only doing the easy/very easy boxes.

            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><a href="TryHackMe.html"><b>TryHackMe</b></a></h3>
            <p>
                THM contains a mix of CTF and teaching. It is a very good learning platform, THM has ‘rooms’ for 
                each topic, for example the Eternal Blue exploit. <br><br>Inside these rooms are teaching content, 
                sometimes its textbook based teaching where you read the text and then apply what you learn to 
                answer a question. <br>Other times its basic Q&A format (this is mostly just for CTFs). I found THM has a nice mix.

            <!-- Programming lang overview-->
            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><a href="Programming.html"><b>Programming</b></a></h3>
            <p>
                Although quite broad, learning a popular programming language is always useful. Many different vulnerabilities 
                already have premade exploits that can be found online (for example on ExploitDB). However, it is important you 
                are able to read and understand the code so you can modify or update the exploit if it's needed.

            <!-- Book information-->
            <h3 style="padding: 10px;"><b><u>Books</u></b></h3>
            <p>
              If you are looking for a book to read, I recommend reading ‘The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing: 
              Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Made Easy’
              <br><br>It is a beginner friendly book that goes over the basics of penetration testing. It formally breaks 
              down the process of testing (goes over the recon phase all the way to wrapping up a penetration test). <br><br>
              The only issue with using books is you need to ensure the book is not too outdated. The book I mentioned 
              received a 2nd edition, in which some content was removed and added (because it was largely no longer relevant).

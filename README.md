# Penting
Penting website

Hello, the files found in this GitHub belong to the Penting guide website found on the Penting VM.

First you will find the website and its pages within. Inside the website folder is the images folder, containing the images for the website.
In addition, a folder named 'avdsecvfret22fold13er' has been added. This is not an mistake and it does belong with Penting.

As this website was designed to work ON the Penting VM, some features will be inaccessible. These features are:
  -The intergrated terminal will not work
  -DVWA and Bad Store will not be accessible
  -Some tasks in the additional task page will not be completable 

Due to GitHub limitations, the VM cannot be uploaded onto here.

Instead Penting (and Bad Store) has been uploaded onto OneDrive and Google Drive.

Both link leads to the same compressed files. Both contain two folders, each containing one OVF for each folder (one OVF for Bad Store, another for Penting).

Download the file and decompress it. Once decompressed, a folder called 'Submitting VMs' will be found, inside containing Penting and Bad Store. Use the .OVF files to import the VMs.
